        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The development of data management and analysis systems largely
          benefits from the advancement of the hardware and software
          technologies. Hardware and software are the two major elements that
          constitute a computing system. The software performance could directly
          benefit from the advancement of hardware, but it is also limited by
          the characteristics of the hardware. Therefore, there has to be
          trade-offs in the design of software frameworks and systems. In the
          meantime, the demands for software performance also promote the
          advancements and innovations of hardware technologies. For data
          management and analysis systems, the hardware determines the
          performance limit of data access and query processing. To fully
          utilize the hardware, the software should optimize the design of
          algorithms and data structure according to the hardware. The
          traditional compute-intensive applications and recent data-intensive
          applications both have placed high demands on hardware performance
          such as access latency, capacity, bandwidth, energy consumption and
          cost performance. Under the various application workloads, the
          traditional data management and analysis techniques are facing
          unprecedented challenges. Essentially, the challenges posed by big
          data are caused by the contradiction where the existing data
          processing infrastructures are incapable of meeting the diverse
          demands in data processing.

          <h3>Did you know ?</h3>
          <p>
            Data processing infrastructure generally includes the underlying
            hardware environment and the upper software system. The design
            principles, architecture selection, core functions, strategy mode,
            and optimization techniques of the upper software system largely
            depend on the computer hardware. Today’s hardware technologies and
            environments are undergoing dramatic changes. Specifically, the
            advent of high-performance processors and hardware accelerators, new
            nonvolatile memory (NVM), and a high-speed network are rapidly
            changing the base support for traditional data management and
            analysis systems. These new hardware is expected to break through
            the architecture of the entire computer system and convert the
            assumptions of the upper software. They also require that the
            architecture of data management and analysis software and related
            technologies have hardware awareness.

          <h3>Interesting facts</h3>
          <p>
            In recent years, storage, processor, and network technologies have
            made a great breakthrough. As shown in Fig. 1, a growing set of new
            hardware, architecture, and features are becoming the foundation of
            the future computing platforms. The current trends indicate that
            these techniques are significantly changing the underlying
            environment of traditional data management and analysis systems,
            including high-performance processors and hardware accelerators,
            NVM, RDMA-capable (remote direct memory access) networks.
            Significantly, the ongoing underlying environments, marked by
            heterogeneous multi-core architecture and hybrid storage hierarchy,
            make the already complicated software design space become more
            sophisticated

          <h4>Facts</h4>
          <p>
            KPMG reports that 100% of enterprises that have put a low-code platform into place have reported a positive ROI.

They also say that the number of business executives who list this type of development as their most important automation investment has nearly tripled since the pandemic began.

Forrester predicted that 75% of all app development would use these types of platforms in 2021. That’s an increase of 31% over 2019.
